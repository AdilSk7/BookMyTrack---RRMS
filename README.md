# Project Description
BookMyTrack is a Railway Reservation Management system is essential for facilitating train reservations for millions of passengers across India. To ensure an inclusive and user-friendly experience, it is crucial to continually assess and enhance gender category management, ensuring accurate representation and respectful accommodation for all genders. Additionally, addressing seating issues is vital for improving passenger satisfaction. A new feature has been introduced where elder passengers are automatically allocated lower berths upon ticket reservation, making their travel experience more comfortable and convenient. This enhancement prioritizes the needs of senior citizens, ensuring a more accommodating travel experience for all.

This project aims to enhance the IRCTC railway reservation system by making it more inclusive and user-friendly for passengers of diverse gender identities. It involves evaluating the existing gender categorization, proposing more inclusive options, ensuring data privacy, and designing an intuitive interface. The project also focuses on integrating gender-specific accommodations, ensuring compliance with relevant laws, and gathering user feedback to continuously improve the system. The ultimate goal is to create a reservation system that better reflects the diversity of its users and provides a safer, more comfortable experience for all passengers.
